This program titled "Will You Be My Date?" is a game that displays an image and asks the player if they want to be the creator's Valentine. The game displays a set of images in a specific folder, and the player can change the images in the folder to their liking. However, certain image file names, such as Background.jpg, Icon.jpg, and yes.jpg (in the Images/Display folder), should not be changed, or it will cause errors in the program.


To play the game, the player must click the "Yes" or "No" button displayed on the screen. Clicking the "Yes" button will display a specific image, and the game will end in a few seconds, while clicking the "No" button will randomly display a different image from the Images/Display folder, along with some text. The player can exit the game by clicking the "x" button on the screen.


This program uses the Pygame library, and the images are in a certain folder. The user can change the images in the folder, but they must be mindful of the specified filenames.
